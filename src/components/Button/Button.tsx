  The button component is amied to solve all instances of a button, not only in the traditional sense.
  Meaning that it supports external links, internal page links, onclick events, or a static button that has no click event attached.
  When meaning static, an example could be a fully clickable card - this could include a visual button meant for afforance,
  while the whole button is clickable, wether that takes the user to a blog post, or opens a dialog window, or an external link.

  This button component is also meant to be scalable (customizable), where various components might be needed to be combined,
  that are unknown or not addressed within here. This is the fallback method. Take for exmaple an avatar accompanied by a user name.
  This situation wouldn't be addressed here but the button component will solve for it, wether that avatar button takes the user to
  an external website, internal page, or an onclick event. All is needed is to import this component into said compnent and use it within there.
  Why this is important is because it automates a few features, such as a background color, and support on click events, without having 
  to write code again.

  The button by default comes bare-bones, meaning there is no visual rendering of a traditional button. This is added once a variant
  is attached to a button. You can view the current varients within the proptypes below.

  Click events supported: 
  • External links - <a href="" target="_blank"></a>
  • Internal links - <Link href=""></Link> ( Following NextJS convention )
  • onClick events - <button onClick={ () => fuunction() }></button>
  • Fallback is a static button, visually representing one, with no click event
